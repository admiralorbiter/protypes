# Development Status - Angles of Authority

**Last Updated:** Initial Setup Complete  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1.1 - Entity Component System Foundation (COMPLETE)  
**Next Milestone:** Map System and Basic Movement

---

## ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 0 & Phase 1.1)

### Project Structure
- [x] Created comprehensive development plan (`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`)
- [x] Set up project folder structure
- [x] Created requirements.txt with dependencies
- [x] Updated main readme to focus on design concepts

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] **Game Loop** (`core/game_loop.py`) - Main game loop with delta time and pause support
- [x] **Scene Manager** (`core/scene_manager.py`) - Scene switching and management system
- [x] **Input Handler** (`core/input_handler.py`) - Keyboard/mouse input with configurable bindings
- [x] **Base Scene Class** (`core/scene.py`) - Abstract base for all game scenes

### Entity Component System (Phase 1.1)
- [x] **Component Classes** (`ecs/component.py`) - Transform, Hitbox, Team, FOV, AIState, Inventory, Camera
- [x] **Entity Class** (`ecs/entity.py`) - Entity container with component management
- [x] **System Classes** (`ecs/system.py`) - Base system and specialized systems (Movement, Render, Collision, AI)
- [x] **Entity Manager** (`ecs/entity_manager.py`) - Central coordination of all entities and systems
- [x] **Entity Factory** (`ecs/entity_factory.py`) - Easy creation of common entity types

### Test & Development Tools
- [x] **Test Scene** (`scenes/test_scene.py`) - Simple scene to verify infrastructure
- [x] **Run Script** (`run.py`) - Easy startup with dependency checking
- [x] **Quick Start Guide** (`README_QUICKSTART.md`) - 5-minute setup guide

## üöß In Progress

### Nothing currently - Phase 0 complete!

---

## üìã Next Steps (Phase 1)

### 1.1 Entity Component System Foundation
- [x] Implement Transform component (position, rotation)
- [x] Implement Hitbox component (collision detection)
- [x] Implement Team component (operator, suspect, civilian, press)
- [x] Implement basic System class for processing components

### 1.2 Map System
- [ ] Create tilemap loader for CSV files
- [ ] Implement basic collision detection
- [ ] Create door system with states (closed, open, kicked)
- [ ] Add cover objects and spawn points

### 1.3 Basic Movement & Controls
- [ ] Implement operator movement with WASD
- [ ] Add operator selection (1/2 keys)
- [ ] Create basic pathfinding (simple A* or greedy steering)
- [ ] Add collision detection for walls and doors
- [ ] Implement pause/unpause functionality (Space)

### 1.4 Basic Rendering
- [ ] Create simple shape renderer for entities
- [ ] Implement basic camera system
- [ ] Add minimap rendering
- [ ] Create simple UI framework

## üéØ Current Goals

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Get basic movement working
2. Create simple map system
3. Implement basic entity rendering

**Short Term (Next Week):**
1. Complete Phase 1 (Core systems & movement)
2. Start Phase 2 (Vision & witness system)
3. Have a playable prototype with basic mechanics

## üîß How to Test Current Build

1. **Setup Environment:**
   ```bash
   cd angles_of_authority
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Dark blue window with "Test Scene" text
   - Counter incrementing each frame
   - Control instructions displayed
   - Console output for R, V, F keys

## üìö Documentation Status

- [x] **Game Design** (`readme.md`) - Complete design document
- [x] **Development Plan** (`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`) - 7-phase implementation roadmap
- [x] **Quick Start Guide** (`README_QUICKSTART.md`) - Setup instructions
- [x] **Development Status** (`DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`) - This document

---

## üêõ Known Issues

**None currently** - Basic infrastructure is working!

---

## üí° Development Tips

1. **Test Early & Often:** Run `python run.py` after each major change
2. **Use Test Scene:** Add new features to `TestScene` first for quick iteration
3. **Follow Phases:** Stick to the development plan to avoid scope creep
4. **Console Output:** Watch for error messages and debug output
5. **Incremental Development:** Build one system at a time

---

## üéÆ Ready to Start Development?

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ **READY** - All infrastructure is in place!

**Next Action:** Start implementing Phase 1.2 (Map System)

**Files to Work On:**
- `maps/` - Map loading and tile system
- `core/camera.py` - Camera and viewport management
- Basic movement components and systems

**Reference:** See `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for detailed task breakdown
